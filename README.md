# Rolling---Android-Game
Powered by Unity

This was a project I got into in the Summer of 2017 and I had a lot of fun with it. Unity is really powerful, especially for beginners. Most interesting scripts under PlayerScript and LevelGenerator. I've learned a lot since writing this code  (in AP Comp. Sci. ) and looking back at some of it makes me cringe, but hopefully my next project will look better. If you want to try this game out, although it never got fully polished, go here:

Also, sorry for no comments. At the time of writing I didn't think I was ever going to release the code.
